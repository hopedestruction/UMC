# UMC

UMC (Universal Miner Configurator) is my first project in python, it aims to unify the configuration of the most popular miners to make their configuration most user friendly as possible.

**WARNING. UMC** is currently in Beta, you can find a really limited experience compared to what it will be in the future, keep it in mind.

## Available Miners Configuration:

[X] nanominer

more miners soon




## Available Coins to Mine:

[X] ERG / ERGO

more coins soon




## Available Pools:

[X] Flypool

more pools soon
